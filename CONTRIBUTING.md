Welcome to Katana!

Commit Style
============
We expect all commits to be in this style.
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

Coding Expections
=================
0. Documentation - code should be self-documenting with comments (if necessary). This includes commits explaning *why* a change is done.
   If you cannot explain *why* a change is occuring, then it was probably not a good change or an ill-planned one. Ask for help on 
   on what you are attempting to fix or improve.
1. Functionality - the code should work.
2. Organization - all functions and classes should have one and only one responsibility. If your class definition exceeds 100 lines,
   it is a general symptom of not-so-good organization. Bundle sub-blocks into *what* is happening. Add comments on *why* something is happening.
3. Testability - all new feature pull requests must have tests as a "proof of work"
4. Modularity - the a reasonable line of code should not necessarily cause fears of catastrophic damage.
   Changes to a specific type functionality should only be done in one place
5. Optimize only when needed - Yes, virtual functions do have slight overhead; however, they offer powerful gains. Nevertheless, it is important
   to acknowledge that something might need to be optimized via or avoiding virtual functions from time to time. All pull requests involving this
   must document a means to ascertain the overhead and the extent of the overhead.

Philosophy
==========

0. Do it at least 80% correctly the 1st time - we balance having standards and maintaining practicality
1. If it is broke, fix it now. (We allow minor formatting errors to be bundled with any type of commit - only minor ones however such as extra lines or spaces).
2. Flag any hacks - during time-critical moments, it may be necessary to do a "hack"; however, these should be flagged in the conventional commit
   as of type "hack" e.g. "hack(feature): fixes [problem]".
3. Really flag any hacks //THIS IS REALLY SUS BECAUSE THAT IS SUS TOO.
4. Branch early, branch often. Try out timelines without consequence, with git we are gods.
5. Bundle complicated things with functions, structs, and classes. (functional programming has its place, but oop exists for a reason).
6. If something feels like an eyesore, it probably is broken or at a high risk of breaking.
7. Take care of yourself - touch grass
8. If there is a good reason to break a rule or principle, break it and document **why**, but know what you are doing.
   If you don't know what you are doing, take the extra time.
9. People are better to ask for help than computers, it helps build **community**, make **friends**, and increase self reliance.
10. A programmer who needs to always look something up every other line or get a programmer (or AI especially) to write it is always less skilled.
11. Take the time to learn. Once you get past the curve, you will find yourself being a god-tier dev!
12. Write as if your code has already been refactor so you don't have to spend time refactoring now.

Version Convention
==================
We use a modified form of semantic versioning.
A major version is simply that where a major addition i.e. CV, more robots
or the start of a new competition cycle. Minor versions will keep incrementing.
The secope of a mejor version/minor version must be defined in the release branch
to prevent eternal release syndrome

Branch Convention
=================
We use the One Flow standard with some modifications:
feature branches begin with feat/ instead of feature. Due to feat
being a standard abbrevation, this makes sense.

Finally, due to this being a firmware project, there is an **important** nuance to main


Branch rules:
main:
* Only commits which have been verified to work on hardware are accepted.
	Whenever the next release has
* Releases must be merged sequentially, if the current release branch is release/v4.8.0
	v4.9.0 cannot be merged regardless. It is reocommended to the current lead dev that
	multiple release branches are merely for stashing slated features not relevant to the current task.
	When the next release is merged, then retest on hardware after updating, then merge that to main
	if it works
* A release is final, if a hotfix must be done, a new one with the 3rd digit incremeted
	i.e. if the most recent tag is v4.8.1, the next tag is v4.8.2 
	if the next release has begun work, it will be merged to main, tagged, then merged
	to the release that is being worked on (v4.8.1 requires a hotfix and v4.9.0 is not ready, so
	the hotfix is merged to main upon verfication on hardware, then tagged under v4.8.2, 
release/*:
* Only commits which compile on test and build as well as pass all unit tests are accepted.
feat/*:
* When these are ready for a pull request, they are pushed onto the github repo, they can **never** be
	merged directly into main.	
hotfix/*:
* These must be verified with hardware, marged directly to main, tagged
	Then merged into the next release/ branch that will be merged.

Coding Style
===========
We use a variant of the Google C++ style: https://google.github.io/styleguide/

## These are the following changes
### Braces
Aligned braces ONLY
```
const char* sensibleBraces()
{
    return "I like Bjarne Stroustrup, but aligned braces (Allman) make too much sense";
}
```

### Variable names
**It is always preferred to make a variable name too long than too short. Code is always read more than it is written, and if you know
how to use tab, you can autocomplete long names.**


Non-const variables shall be mixedCase beginning with lowercase. 
```
double coolVariable{};
```
Const variables shall begin with k. kVariable. This is a departure from the k\_variable convention.

```
const double kEternallyCoolVariable{};
```

### Initialization
Under all circumstances uniform-bracket initialiation shall be used.

```
int count{10};
```

### Enums
After long deliberation, we have noted that C++ standards have been departing from 90s-era C standards.
Due to the issue of preprocessor directives causing an increasing amount of conflicts with anything in SHOUT\_CASE,
a new standard for enums must be adopted.

Google's style of kEnumName, is found to be too cumbersome and unecessarily pedantic as enum classes are accessed as
EnumClassName::enum.

The simple solution is to use lowerMixedCase.
```
enum class Friendliness
{
    befriendAllThings,
    friendly,
    destroy,
    destroyAllThings  
};

robot.setPersonality(Friendliness::befriendAllThings);
```

For enums (which are **heavily** discouranged), the kEnumName is **heavily** encouraged.


### Class
#### Members
##### Member Variables
This is a departure from the learncpp.com style with appending m. It has been found to be cumbersome
in having a constant member variable be named mk\_variable (when signifying immutibility). k\_variable
was reserved for non-member consts. In order to reduce the chance of naming conflicts/shadowing, non-static constant
member variables shall have a k appendend to the beginning of the name and a _ to the end to the end.

All private member variables shall end with \_
```
class Club
{
public:
    static constexpr int kMaxCapacity{10};
private:
    static constexpr int kBudgetRedLimit{1000};
    const int kDanceFloorLength_;
    int peopleCount_;
};
```

##### Static Functions - mixed case beginning with lower case Class::staticFunction()

### Interfaces
Interface Naming Conventions. An interface (purely abstract class with virtual functions), shall be appended with I.
I love taproot, but DjiMotorInterface is more cumbersome than IDjiMotor. It also immediately informs the user that
they are dealing with an abstract class.
```
ICoolInterface& cool{glacier};
```
